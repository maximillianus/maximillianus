### Hi there üëã

Nice to meet all of you! I am Data, AI, and Cloud enthusiast. I specializes in analytics, AI/ML, system design, infrastructure as code, observability, and DevSecOps.

On top of that, I have strong enthusiasm towards software engineering and all things related to building robust, distributed, scalable systems. I love to explore various software engineering disciplines such as front-end/back-end/mobile-app development, networking, microservices, performance optimization (‚ù§Ô∏è), and testing.
